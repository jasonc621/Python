#Numeric Data Types

#ints - integer number, just like in math: 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, 0, 500, 1000, 51024, -9999
#floats - decimal numers: 1.9, 3.7, 1.7, 2.0

#2 vs. 2.0: Python sees 2 as the int,2 but it sees 2.0 and as the float, 2.0 and 2.

#Strings - sequences of characters: 'A13', 'Hello, World', '4'. 
#Strings are denoted with single quotes. Technically you can get away with double quotes, 
#and occasionally, double quotes are needed but professionally python needed 

#Each character in a string has a positon (aka an index). The First
#characters incex is 0. The next character's is 1, etc. For example,
#the 0th character in 'Hello, World' is H. The 6th character in 
#'Hello, World' is a space.

#Operations:

# + means add with ints:

print(2 + 3)

# + means add floats

print(2.0 + 1.5)

# + means add when combining an int and a float.  
#When Python adds an int to a float the result is a float.
print(2 + 3.0)

#means __ when combining strings.
print('Computer' + 'Science')
print('10' + '5')
